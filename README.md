# Password Generator

## Description
This project was designed as a homework assignment for Rutgers coding bootcamp and introduces the use of JavaScript in the course. 

I was required to code a random password generator that met all of the acceptance criteria (listed below).

## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN I need a new, secure password
* WHEN I click the button to generate a password
* THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* WHEN prompted for password criteria
* THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
* WHEN prompted for the length of the password
* THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
* THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* WHEN I answer each prompt
* THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* WHEN all prompts are answered
* THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* WHEN the password is generated
* THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Summary
The project has:
* A generate button that will start a series of prompts in the browser window for the user
* A series of prompts that asks the user what criteria they'd like to have for their password (password length and characters to use)
* After the user has selected which criteria to use in their password, a random password is generated and displayed in the text area of the password generator
